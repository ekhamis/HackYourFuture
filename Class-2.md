# Class 2 preview 

Using `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`
Primary keys and foreign keys (and a quick discussion of constraints)
When you go into a company you are usually not creating a database from scratch but rather using an existing one that you will need to become familiar with. 
We will discuss how to look at a database `schema` (major key!) and understand what is happening. 

Next we will look at how to read and write data from MySQL using  Node.js. 

Your homework will be to change the todo project that you worked on in the last class to use MySQL instead of a text file to store the Todos.
