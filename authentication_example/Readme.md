### Authentication example

Please read this before you try the example. 

## Prerequisites
You will need mysql installed locally on your machine 

## Code structure 
The code is intentionally not strucutred in the best way so that you can see how the pieces fit together better. I encourage you to read a few articles to understand what best practice looks like so you can structure your own code better in the future. 

Here are a few links:

*REMEMBER - THE STYLE YOU CHOOSE IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN BEING CONSISTENT!!!*

## Getting started
1. Go to the `mysql` directory of this repo wherever you cloned it on your machine. E.g. `cd c:\timir\projects\authentication_example\mysql`

1. Start your mysql client in a terminal window. On my machine this is `mysql -u root -p` and enter the root password. 

1. When you have the `mysql>` prompt type `source ./schema.sql` and the database and tables will be built for you. They are very simple. Look in the `schema.sql` file to make sure you understand what is happening. 

1. `exit` the mysql command prompt

1. Go back to the root directory (`authentication_example`) and get the packages you need by running `npm install`.

1. If there is no error you should be ready to start the server by typing `npm start`

1. The server will tell you it is running and ready for connections

1. Open Postman. You will create three requests. Make sure you have selected `raw` and `JSON` for the content type. 
1. Add a user -  POST the JSON below in the request body to `localhost:8080/user/add`
`{ "email": "tkaria@gmail.com", 
  "password": "foobar"}`
and press `Send`

1. Try to authenticate - create a new POST the same JSON as above to the endpoint `localhost:8080/auth/email`. You should get your user_id and email back. THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO - I just wanted to show you basic mechanism for authentication without all the encryption and tokens. 

1. Get a token - make another POST the same JSON as above to the endpoint `localhost:8080/auth/email2`. You will get back a token and a message. Copy the token text without the quotes. 

1. Create a new GET request. You will try to access a resource (stuff on the server) that requires authentication and you will supply the token to prove your identity. The endpoint for the GET request is `localhost:8080/api/secret_stuff`. Press `Send` ... IT FAILS! Why? You didn't supply the token in the header yet. To fix this choose the Headers tab and add a key named `Authorization` and paste the token in the value field. Press `Send` again and it should work. 

1. The token is set to expire after 5 minutes (this is set in the config file) so wait 5 minutes and try again and you should get a failure.
